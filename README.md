## Shell:

# Requirements

1. I use iterm2 on OSX, this setup will only work for that.
2. vim must be installed, I highly recommend you install it view homebrew with 'brew install vim'
3. git must be installed and setup with ssh for github

As part of the process, this will install the latest version of oh-my-zsh and set your default shell to it.


# Install

1. git clone git@github.com:/wordswords/dotfiles ./dotfiles/
2. cd ~/.dotfiles/
3. ./deploy-part-1.sh
4. ./deploy-part-2.sh
5. Profit.

If you want, you can fork this repo and base your config on this. If you have any problems using these dotfiles please let me know and I can help you.
